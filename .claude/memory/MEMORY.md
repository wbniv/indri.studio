# Memory Index

- [Copy / pitch style defaults](copy-style-pitches.md) — when user delegates, prefer outcome-stated headlines, tight single-audience focus, aggressive artifact removal
- [Commit at confirmation](feedback-commit-at-confirmation.md) — "looks good"/"let's keep it"/"perfect" ends an iteration: commit that turn, don't ask
- [Illustration style: 3D Pixar, not flat vector](feedback-illustration-style.md) — for Indri character/mascot art, prefer Pixar-render aesthetic; flat-edge brand applies to UI only
- [Plan-first before code](feedback-plan-first-before-code.md) — write plan to `docs/plans/` even when user seems impatient; verbal-only plans vanish in crashes
- [Preview plans in browser, not terminal](feedback-plan-preview-in-browser.md) — write plan to `docs/plans/`, then `task md` to render; terminal ExitPlanMode preview is unreadable
- [Cloudflare _headers merges rules](feedback-cloudflare-headers-merge.md) — WSA _headers accumulates all matching rules; never use `/*` catch-all with specific path rules for same header; use Worker instead
- [Forced reflow on first paint](feedback-forced-reflow-first-paint.md) — scripts that read layout (scrollY/innerHeight/getBoundingClientRect) + write styles stall first paint; skip when default applies, else defer with requestIdleCallback
- [Render design artifacts, don't describe them](feedback-render-design-artifacts.md) — icons, swatches, type samples must be rendered as actual HTML in design docs; text substitutes (icon names, hex strings) are not acceptable
- [Project-scoped state, not GH-org-scoped](feedback-project-scoped-state.md) — secrets buckets, bootstrap caches, CF tokens scope off `<zone-slug>`/`<CUSTOM_DOMAIN>`, never off `${GH_ORG}` — wbniv hosts multiple projects that must not collide
- [Apt repos under wbniv](project-apt-repos-on-cloudflare.md) — current: apt.worldfoundry.org, apt.indri.studio; planned: apt.biohack.net — naming convention + cross-repo isolation rules

## User (inherited from ~)

- [User profile](user_profile.md) — Will's role, setup, and desktop/dev preferences
- [Mammouth.ai subscription](user_mammouth_subscription.md) — €20/mo Mammouth.ai Standard: multi-model API (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Llama) at api.mammouth.ai/v1

## Project (inherited from ~)

- [Flat homedir layout](home_src_layout.md) — ~/SRC is gone; every project lives at ~/<name>, shared docs at ~/CLAUDE.md + ~/docs/ — never recreate an SRC compat path
- [Laptop comparison investigation](laptop-comparison-investigation.md) — 32GB eBay laptop compare; deliverable done in docs/investigations; open TODO = send #7 pick link (phone/Trello/email all blocked)

## Feedback (inherited from ~)

- [Host tooling is dbox-only](host-tooling-dbox-only.md) — no node/terraform on host, only podman; use bin/dbox
- [Setup flows are tasks](setup-flows-are-tasks.md) — provisioning always via task setup/scripts/setup.sh, never manual instructions
- [Always Astro + Tailwind](feedback_always_astro_tailwind.md) — Always scaffold Astro + Tailwind 4 + @theme tokens even when design is undecided; path choice is infra, not framework
- [Bangkok cost estimates](feedback_bangkok_cost_estimates.md) — Default lower on Bangkok cost estimates; verify against Lalamove/Grab/Makro/local norms, not Western/expat-tier defaults
- [Commit scope](feedback_commit_scope.md) — "Commit the others" means the files just enumerated, not everything git status shows; auto-mode doesn't expand scope
- [Excluded providers](feedback_excluded_providers.md) — Don't recommend Facebook/Meta (except WhatsApp) or Oracle as providers anywhere; Oracle's "Always Free" ARM tier is mostly fictional (capacity-starved)
- [Legacy encoding edit corruption](feedback_legacy_encoding_edit_corruption.md) — Edit/Write round-trip through UTF-8 and silently corrupt non-UTF-8 high bytes (CP437, Latin-1, etc.) into U+FFFD; edit byte-safely (sed/perl/python) on legacy-encoded files
- [Markdown renderer drops autolinks](feedback_md_renderer_no_autolinks.md) — md-to-pdf.sh silently drops `<url>` autolinks; always use `[url](url)` form
- [Don't speculate](feedback_no_speculation.md) — Verify before advising: RDAP for domains, file reads for config, the screenshot already on screen — don't list generic "common causes" when state is fetchable
- [Node 24 everywhere](feedback_node24_everywhere.md) — Always use Node 24 on all supported platforms; confirmed: GitHub Actions, Codemagic.io
- [Prefer the proper fix](feedback_prefer_proper_fix.md) — When offering fix-scope options, default to the proper/architectural one. Don't lead with the minimal fix as "recommended"
- [Public vs internal surfaces](feedback_public_vs_internal_surfaces.md) — Public marketing pages (colophon, homepage) describe visible craft — never internal infra (repo URLs, predecessor projects, deploy pipeline, IaC paths)
- [Run task md](feedback_run_task_md.md) — After writing/editing any .md file, run `task md -- {filename}` to preview in browser; never run on non-markdown files
- [Seed, don't clone](feedback_seed_dont_clone.md) — Seeding a new site from an existing one + swapping wordmark/color isn't enough — the source's visual fingerprint carries through. Ship distinctive elements with the seed, not after
- [Tooling choices](feedback_tooling_choices.md) — Prefer hand-rolled over integration libs when Will already does the pattern manually (e.g., PWA); convert content to Markdown upfront, not "start HTML, migrate later"
- [Use task tracking](feedback_use_task_tracking.md) — Reach for TaskCreate/TaskUpdate proactively on multi-step work; don't wait for the auto-reminder
- [Wayland keybindings](feedback_wayland_keybindings.md) — How held modifiers combine with ydotool on GNOME Wayland; architecture for tab switching across apps
- [WezTerm Flatpak CLI](feedback_wezterm_flatpak.md) — Use flatpak enter + GUI socket (not flatpak run or mux socket) for WezTerm CLI access
- [Audit-deferrals hook force-adds TODO](audit-deferrals-hook-force-adds-todo.md) — audit-plan-deferrals used to git-add the whole TODO.md into a plan commit — FIXED in python-tui-lib 4f88186
- [Close net-negative findings, don't defer](close-net-negative-findings-not-defer.md) — When a measurement shows a change is net-negative, close it as a recorded negative result — don't carry it as deferred/future work
- [Investigations on throwaway branches](investigations-on-throwaway-branches.md) — Run exploratory/measurement work on disposable git branches/worktrees, never on main's working copy
- [No false-choice questions](no-false-choice-questions.md) — Don't pose AskUserQuestion forks where all options collapse to the same next action or one is the obvious default — just act and state it
- [Fix inaccuracies as you find them](fix-inaccuracies-as-you-find-them.md) — Stale counts, colliding numbers, contradictory docs: fix in the same pass and say so; don't report-and-ask
